# KeySense

**KeySense** is a real-time keyboard heatmap tracker and logger built in Python. It captures global keypress events, visualizes usage intensity in a Pygame-based UI, and logs the frequency and timestamp of each keypress. This project is useful for productivity tracking, typing behavior analysis, or just for fun!
